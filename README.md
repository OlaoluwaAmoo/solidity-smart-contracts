# solidity-smart-contracts
A collection of simple Solidity smart contracts I built while learning (ERC-20, ERC-721, and a Voting dApp).

Welcome 👋  
This repo contains some of my practice projects as I learn and grow as a Solidity developer.  
I (skutii) use this space to explore different aspects of smart contracts and Web3 development.  

---

## 📂 Contracts Included
- **ERC-20 Token**  
  A basic fungible token with mint and burn functions.  
- **ERC-721 NFT**  
  A simple NFT contract with a minting function.  
- **Voting Contract**  
  A governance contract where users can create proposals and vote.

---

## 🛠 Tools & Frameworks
- **Solidity** (0.8.x)  
- **Remix IDE** (for writing & testing contracts)  
- **MetaMask** + **Sepolia Testnet** (for deployment)  
- **GitHub** (to track my progress)  

---

## 🚀 How I Practice
- Write contracts in Solidity.  
- Test them on Remix using Sepolia Testnet.  
- Deploy small upgrades and improvements over time.  
- Document my journey here (skutii’s learning log 📝).  

---

## ✅ Next Steps
- Experiment with Hardhat and Truffle.  
- Build a dApp frontend that interacts with these contracts.  
- Expand this repo into a full blockchain portfolio.
